# Module 3: Robot Simulation and NVIDIA Isaac Platform

Welcome to the third module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course! This module covers robot simulation environments and the NVIDIA Isaac platform.

## Overview

In this module (Weeks 6-10), we'll explore:
- Robot Simulation with Gazebo (Weeks 6-7)
- NVIDIA Isaac Platform (Weeks 8-10)

### Weeks 6-7: Robot Simulation with Gazebo
- Gazebo simulation environment setup
- URDF and SDF robot description formats
- Physics simulation and sensor simulation
- Introduction to Unity for robot visualization

### Weeks 8-10: NVIDIA Isaac Platform
- NVIDIA Isaac SDK and Isaac Sim
- AI-powered perception and manipulation
- Reinforcement learning for robot control
- Sim-to-real transfer techniques

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Create robot models using URDF and SDF
