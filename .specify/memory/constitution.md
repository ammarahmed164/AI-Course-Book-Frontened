# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Embodied Intelligence Focus
Physical AI systems must be grounded in real-world robotics applications; All theoretical concepts require practical implementation examples; Emphasis on embodied cognition over purely digital AI approaches.

### II. Technical Accuracy & Real-World Alignment
All technical descriptions must reflect actual robotics toolchains and workflows; No hallucinated APIs, hardware specifications, or robotic systems; Content must align with industry-standard implementations.

### III. Reproducible Simulation-to-Real Pipeline
Every simulation environment and deployment pipeline must be reproducible; Content must support both simulated learning and physical robot deployment; Steps must be executable and verifiable by readers.

### IV. Industry-Grade Practices
All code examples and workflows must follow production-relevant practices; Use of professional development standards throughout; Preparation for real-world robotics engineering careers.

### V. Comprehensive Testing & Validation
All code examples and simulations must be executable and tested; Each chapter requires working examples; Technical content must be validated against actual robotics systems.

### VI. Academic Excellence & RIGOR
Content must meet university-level educational standards; Clear separation between theoretical foundations, implementation details, and deployment considerations; Step-by-step explanations for complex simulations and pipelines.

## Course-aligned Scope

The textbook supports a complete quarter-level university course covering Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. The content includes ROS 2 middleware (nodes, topics, services, rclpy, URDF), digital twins and simulation (Gazebo, Unity), NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS, VSLAM, navigation, and humanoid motion (Nav2), Vision-Language-Action systems, voice-to-action using OpenAI Whisper, and concludes with a capstone: fully autonomous simulated humanoid robot.

## RAG Chatbot Integration

The textbook includes an integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot that answers questions grounded strictly in book content. The chatbot must support user-selected text queries and be implemented using OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres, and Qdrant Cloud.

## Governance

This constitution governs all project decisions and supersedes conflicting practices. Amendments require formal documentation, approval by core maintainers, and migration plans when applicable. All content must comply with zero plagiarism standards and static-site compatibility requirements. Each contribution must be verified for technical accuracy against real robotics systems.
