# Motivation: Why Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence?

```
## The Limitations of Digital-Only AI
```

Traditional AI systems operate in purely digital environments. They process text, images, audio, and video, but they don't directly interact with the physical world. While these systems have achieved remarkable success, they represent only part of the AI story.

## The Rise of Embodied Intelligence
```

Physical AI, or embodied intelligence, represents a paradigm shift toward AI systems that:
- Perceive and understand the physical world
- Interact with objects and environments
- Learn from physical interactions
- Adapt to real-world uncertainties and dynamics

## Why Humanoid Robotics?
```

Humanoid robots are particularly compelling because they:
- Operate in human-designed environments
- Can perform tasks originally designed for humans
- Enable natural human-robot interaction
- Provide insights into human intelligence and movement
