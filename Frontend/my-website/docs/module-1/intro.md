# Module 1: Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course! This module covers the foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence.

## Overview

In this module (Weeks 1-2), we'll explore:
- Foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- The transition from digital AI to robots that understand physical laws
- Overview of the humanoid robotics landscape
- Sensor systems: LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, force/torque sensors

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental differences between digital AI and Physical AI
- Explain the concept of embodied intelligence
- Identify key components of humanoid robotics
- Recognize different types of sensors used in robotics

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of AI concepts
- Familiarity with robotics terminology

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several lessons that build upon each other:

1. [Foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence](./week1-2-foundations)
2. [From digital AI to robots that understand physical laws](./week1-2-physical-ai)
3. [Overview of humanoid robotics landscape](./week1-2-humanoid-landscape)
4. [Sensor systems: LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, force/torque sensors](./week1-2-sensor-systems)

## Getting Started

Begin with the first lesson to explore the foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence.
