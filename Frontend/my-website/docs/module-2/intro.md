# Module 2: ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to the second module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course! This module covers the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2).

## Overview

In this module (Weeks 3-5), we'll explore:
- ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Building ROS 2 packages with Python
- Launch files and parameter management

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the architecture and concepts of ROS 2
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Develop ROS 2 packages using Python
- Use launch files and manage parameters effectively

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Knowledge of Module 1 concepts
- Familiarity with robotics terminology

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several lessons that build upon each other:
