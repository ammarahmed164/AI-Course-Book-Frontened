# Module 4: Conversational Robotics and AI Integration

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course! This module focuses on conversational robotics and AI integration, teaching you how to create natural, interactive robots that can communicate effectively with humans.

## Overview

In this module (Weeks 11-13), we'll explore:
- Humanoid robot development and design principles (Weeks 11-12)
- Conversational robotics and natural language interaction (Week 13)

### Weeks 11-12: Humanoid Robot Development
- Humanoid robot kinematics and dynamics
- Bipedal locomotion and balance control
- Manipulation and grasping with humanoid hands
- Natural human-robot interaction design

### Week 13: Conversational Robotics
- Integrating GPT models for conversational AI in robots
- Speech recognition and natural language understanding
- Multi-modal interaction: speech, gesture, vision

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Design and control humanoid robot systems with proper kinematics and dynamics
- Implement bipedal locomotion and balance control algorithms
- Create natural human-robot interaction experiences
- Integrate conversational AI models into robotic systems
- Implement speech recognition and natural language understanding
- Design multi-modal interaction systems combining speech, gesture, and vision

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals (Module 2)
- Knowledge of simulation environments (Module 3)
- Basic familiarity with control theory and kinematics
